### Production token-secret boundary

For a live production workspace, set independent random values of at least 32 characters for `SNEUP_API_TOKEN_PEPPER`, `SNEUP_SESSION_TOKEN_PEPPER`, and `SNEUP_INVITE_TOKEN_PEPPER`. Sneup refuses to start a non-demo production runtime when any of these is absent, weak, or still a placeholder. This prevents database API tokens, desktop sessions, and invitation tokens from being hashed with predictable development defaults. Before an invitation can be issued in production, configure `SNEUP_PUBLIC_URL` as a non-local HTTPS origin with no credentials, query parameters, or fragment; this keeps the one-time invite token out of a preconfigured URL component.

Before a live release, run `npm run check:release-security` with the deployment environment loaded. It confirms, without printing their values, that the three token peppers plus `CONNECTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `CONNECTOR_STATE_SECRET` are present, non-placeholder, at least 32 characters, and distinct by purpose. The command fails for demo or non-production environments so a release pipeline cannot accidentally treat a local configuration as deployment evidence.

Run `npm run doctor` before startup to inspect the runtime, live/demo mode, database and Trello prerequisites, remote API protection, production secret posture, and provider-write emergency stop without printing secret values. `GET /ready` is the machine-readable startup probe; a live critical path requires `criticalPathReady: true`. Set `SNEUP_PROVIDER_WRITES_DISABLED=true` and restart to stop every external provider write before execution is claimed while retaining read-only sync and analysis for incident investigation.

Runtime logs redact credentials, authorization headers, cookies, credential-bearing query parameters, provider request configuration, and retained work content before Winston serializes an event. Chat processing logs opaque IDs and routing metadata only, never a worker message excerpt or username.

Terminal workspace invitations are retained as lifecycle evidence only. The daily `identity.invitation_retention` job redacts the invite email, display name, token prefix, token hash, and delivery failure code after `SNEUP_INVITE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `90`, bounded from `7` to `3650`) while preserving status, role, dates, and aggregate workspace audit evidence. Tune the bounded batch with `SNEUP_INVITE_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` (default `100`, maximum `250`) and the scheduled run with `SNEUP_INVITE_RETENTION_CRON`.

The Windows installer uses the bundled Sneup icon. Release signing and automatic updates remain release-infrastructure tasks: configure a publisher certificate and update feed in the release environment before distributing a trusted production build.

### Authenticated ngrok cloud access

Sneup can open an ngrok ingress while keeping the HTTP server on loopback. Set `SNEUP_NGROK_ENABLED=true`, `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`, `SNEUP_REQUIRE_API_KEY=true`, and a unique `SNEUP_API_KEY` of at least 32 characters, then start Sneup normally. An optional `SNEUP_NGROK_DOMAIN` selects a reserved domain. Startup fails closed if any authentication prerequisite is missing, and `npm run doctor` validates the posture without exposing secret values. Remote browser users join through a one-time workspace invitation and then use the short-lived session token stored only in that browser session.

See `docs/CLOUD_AND_HAI.md` for the Windows, ngrok, HAI, and shutdown flow.

See `docs/MULTI_WORKSPACE_IDENTITY.md` for workspace selection, session token, and production migration notes.

Workspace exports are generated collection by collection with bounded MongoDB cursors, so Sneup does not buffer a full workspace in server memory. The command center uses a streaming file save when the browser supports it. Every export requires the workspace owner role, records start and completion evidence, and recursively excludes connector credentials, authentication hashes and prefixes, passwords, signing secrets, and encrypted notification destinations. The final `complete` line contains per-collection counts; treat an export without that line as incomplete.

Permanent deletion is available only to the authenticated owner of an archived workspace. It requires the exact workspace slug plus an explicit irreversible-deletion acknowledgement. Sneup locks the workspace in a non-operational `deleting` state, removes all 39 registered workspace collections sequentially, removes identity tokens and the workspace record last, and retains only a non-identifying receipt. Interrupted work is lease-protected and resumable. Five bounded follow-up sweeps catch late in-flight writes before the receipt removes its temporary technical workspace reference. Provider accounts are not changed at the provider; their local encrypted credentials are deleted, and provider-side grant revocation remains an owner action.

### Workspace Action Safety

- `GET /api/policy-rules` - List the effective workspace safety posture for each supported Trello write action
- `GET /api/policy-rules/history` - List recent workspace action-safety changes from the audit ledger
- `PUT /api/policy-rules/:actionType` - Pause an action type, optionally set a future `pauseExpiresAt` review time, or raise its risk/decision-owner posture (`policy-rules:manage`)

Trello writes remain approval-gated regardless of a workspace rule. A rule can pause a write action, raise its risk, or route its decision to a stricter owner. An optional future pause review time makes an overdue pause visible, but it never re-enables an action automatically. Re-enabling a paused action or relaxing a prior workspace rule requires explicit confirmation and creates an audit event. The Workspace command center shows the latest bounded policy history. The executor resolves this policy immediately before its atomic execution claim, so a pause also blocks recommendations approved before the policy changed. Approved payloads also expire before execution (critical: 4 hours, high: 24 hours, medium: 72 hours, low: 168 hours by default); Sneup returns an expired item to the internal decision queue, records the expiry, and requires review of the unchanged protected payload before any provider write. Operators can shorten or extend each risk window only within 1 to 168 hours through `SNEUP_APPROVAL_TTL_CRITICAL_HOURS`, `SNEUP_APPROVAL_TTL_HIGH_HOURS`, `SNEUP_APPROVAL_TTL_MEDIUM_HOURS`, and `SNEUP_APPROVAL_TTL_LOW_HOURS`. A separate bounded outcome worker rechecks completed actions only against existing Sneup evidence after a 24-hour settling window by default; it never sends another provider request, skips already-confirmed outcomes, and avoids writing duplicate unchanged audit events.

Sneup also retains a workspace-scoped, read-only recommendation-feedback signal for approval, rejection, change-request, execution, and outcome status. This supports operator reporting through `GET /api/analytics/recommendation-feedback`, but it is never read by policy resolution or execution authorization, so prior acceptance patterns cannot weaken approval requirements.

### HAI Connector

- `GET /api/integrations/hai/manifest` - Discover the least-privilege HAI connector contract
- `GET /api/integrations/hai/openapi.json` - Read the machine-readable HAI API contract
- `GET /api/integrations/hai/snapshot` - Read a bounded and redacted operating snapshot
- `POST /api/integrations/hai/proposals` - Queue an HAI suggestion as an approval-gated recommendation

Issue HAI a workspace API token scoped only to `integrations:hai:read` and, when proposals are needed, `integrations:hai:propose`. The connector intentionally exposes no approval or execution operation. HAI suggestions enter Sneup's recommendation and Yes/No decision ledger; consequential provider actions still need exact-payload human approval inside Sneup.

### Connectors and Work Signals

Live credential-backed ingestion is available for Trello, Jira, Asana, Slack, GitHub, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Linear, Notion, monday.com, ClickUp, Azure DevOps, Wrike, Smartsheet, Airtable, Todoist, Shortcut, Bitbucket, Harvest, Everhour, Lucen Track (Timeneye), Motion, Coda, Teamwork, TeamGantt, Businessmap, Basecamp, Redmine, Scoro, Make, and n8n. The monday.com reader uses the `boards:read` scope only, reads board and item metadata through the GraphQL API, excludes item descriptions and updates, and fails visibly at configured board or item limits rather than silently skipping work. The ClickUp reader syncs authorized-workspace task metadata with bounded pages and update-time lookback, discarding task descriptions before graph storage. The Azure DevOps reader uses a PAT restricted to Work Items Read, requires a public `https://dev.azure.com/organization` URL, runs bounded WIQL reads, and retrieves selected work-item fields plus relation metadata only. The Wrike reader uses only GET requests for bounded project and task metadata, requests the minimal owner/parent/dependency identifiers needed for graph context, and intentionally excludes descriptions, comments, custom fields, and attachments. The Smartsheet reader makes bounded GET requests for sheet, column, and selected-row metadata, filters deltas by row modification time, and never requests attachments, discussions, row links, or arbitrary cell columns. The Airtable reader needs an explicit base, table, and allowlisted task fields; it uses only paginated record GET requests and never discovers or stores unrelated fields. The Todoist reader fetches only bounded project and task metadata using GET requests, omits task descriptions before graph storage, and fails visibly at configured project or task limits. The Shortcut reader uses only GET requests for a bounded number of projects and stories, retains story links as dependency metadata, and excludes descriptions, comments, files, labels, and custom fields before graph storage. The Bitbucket reader requires one workspace slug and an API token with repository, issue, and pull-request read access; it uses only bounded GET pages and strips descriptions, comments, diffs, deployment data, and arbitrary repository fields before graph storage. The Harvest reader requires a numeric account ID and personal access token, reads only bounded paginated time-entry metadata with `GET`, and deliberately excludes notes, rates, invoice status, and budget data. The Everhour reader uses a GET-only bounded recent time-entry request with its API key header and deliberately excludes descriptions, notes, budgets, expenses, invoices, rates, and person/profile discovery. The Lucen Track reader requires an explicitly selected member ID and personal access token, uses bounded GET-only paginated time-entry reads, retains only opaque IDs, entry dates, and minutes for confirmed capacity mappings, and excludes notes, clients, costs, revenue, profit, billing, lock state, sources, URLs, project names, team profiles, and provider writes. The Coda reader requires an explicit comma-separated document allowlist and reads only bounded table metadata with `GET`; it never requests table rows, column values, pages, packs, or button actions. The Teamwork reader requires one HTTPS `*.teamwork.com` tenant URL and API key, reads bounded project and task metadata with GET and update-time lookback, and excludes private tasks, descriptions, comments, files, time, company, and billing data. The TeamGantt reader requires an explicit company ID and personal access token, uses bounded GET-only project and paginated task requests, limits each response to 2 MB by default, redacts email addresses and URLs in retained titles, and excludes descriptions, comments, checklists, resources, time blocks, custom fields, provider URLs, and provider writes. The Basecamp reader selects one authorized account and ingests bounded project and to-do metadata with GET only. The Scoro reader requires one exact `https://company.scoro.com` tenant, account ID, and API token; it performs bounded metadata-only list requests for projects and tasks, excludes descriptions, comments, people, customer, CRM, finance, utilization, custom fields, URLs, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection limits. The Redmine reader requires a public HTTPS base URL and API key, disables redirects and proxy use, reads bounded project and issue metadata with update-time lookback, retains issue-relation identifiers for the work graph, and excludes descriptions, journals, custom fields, attachments, time entries, wiki, and forum content. The Make reader accepts only `scenarios:read`, one explicit numeric team ID, and an allowlisted Make region; it uses one bounded GET request for scenario metadata and excludes blueprints, modules, connections, webhooks, execution data, and provider writes. The n8n reader accepts one public HTTPS instance URL and API key, uses GET-only bounded reads for active workflow and execution metadata, pins DNS lookups to public addresses, and excludes workflow definitions, node configuration, credentials, execution data, and error payloads before graph storage.

Plane is available for one explicit Plane Cloud workspace slug and an API key restricted to `projects:read` and `projects.work_items:read`. Sneup uses bounded GET-only cursor pagination for project and work-item metadata, excludes descriptions, assignees, labels, comments, attachments, custom fields, URLs, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection limits.

Kantata OX (formerly Mavenlink) connects through an administrator-registered OAuth application. Sneup reads only bounded workspace (project) metadata from its fixed HTTPS API endpoint, redacts emails and URLs from retained titles, and excludes stories, people, schedules, resource allocations, budgets, financials, attachments, comments, custom fields, provider URLs, and provider writes.

LiquidPlanner New connects with an administrator-created API token and one explicit numeric workspace ID. Sneup uses only the documented, bounded GET-only active-project listing with continuation-token pagination, retaining redacted project names, opaque IDs, lifecycle state, and dates.

Ravetree connects with a user-created API token that has only the documented work-items view permission. Sneup uses Ravetree's fixed Open API host and bounded offset pagination, retaining redacted work-item titles, opaque IDs, completion state, and dates. It excludes details, people, accounts, contacts, teams, dependencies, time, tags, custom fields, URLs, and provider writes.

Todoist uses its fixed HTTPS API host with bounded project and task collections, a 1 MB response ceiling by default, no redirects, and no proxy use. Sneup redacts email addresses and URLs from retained titles and excludes task descriptions, comments, attachments, provider URLs, and provider writes.

Airtable requires an explicit base, table, and allowlisted task fields. Sneup rejects malformed or repeated page cursors, caps each fixed-host response at 1 MB by default, disables redirects and proxy use, redacts emails and URLs from retained field values, and excludes unselected fields, provider URLs, and provider writes.

Motion is available for one explicit workspace and API key. Sneup uses fixed-host GET-only cursor pagination for project and task metadata, keeps only redacted titles, opaque IDs, schedule state, dates, durations, scheduling-issue flags, and opaque task-assignee IDs only for explicit capacity mappings. It excludes descriptions, creators, assignee names and emails, labels, custom fields, embedded project or workspace data, and provider writes.

OpenProject is available for one public HTTPS instance and a bearer API token. Sneup pins each sync to public DNS results, uses bounded GET-only project and work-package metadata requests with server-side field selection, excludes descriptions, comments, attachments, people, custom fields, URLs, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection limits.

Microsoft Project connects through Microsoft OAuth with `Tasks.Read` only. Project for the web retired in 2025, so Sneup reads bounded basic Planner plan and task metadata through Microsoft Graph; premium plans, legacy Project Online data, task details, checklists, comments, attachments, people, custom fields, URLs, and provider writes remain outside the connector.

TestRail is available for one explicit public HTTPS tenant, username, API key, and numeric project ID. Sneup uses one bounded GET request for active test-run metadata, rejects paginated overflow, pins DNS to public addresses, and excludes cases, results, descriptions, references, custom fields, attachments, and provider writes.

BrowserStack is available with a username and access key. Sneup performs one fixed-host, bounded Automate build-list GET, fails closed when its page cap is reached, and retains only build ID, redacted name, status, priority, completion state, and bounded duration. It excludes public URLs, tags, sessions, logs, browser and device data, and provider writes.

OneDrive is available as a separate Microsoft OAuth connection with `Files.Read` only. Sneup makes one bounded GET to the signed-in user's drive root, fails visibly if Graph signals a further page, and retains only redacted item names, type, and created/updated metadata. It excludes file content, web URLs, permissions, versions, shared links, and provider writes.

SharePoint is available as a separate Microsoft OAuth connection. It explicitly presents the delegated `Sites.Read.All` grant for review, lists only sites the signed-in user follows, requires one site to be selected, and then makes one capped root-metadata GET with `Files.Read`. It retains only redacted file or folder names, opaque identifiers, and timestamps; file contents, web URLs, permissions, pages, lists, people, versions, and sharing details are excluded.

Xero is available as a separate OAuth connection with `accounting.invoices.read`. Sneup lists authorized organisations, requires one selection, and makes one capped GET for sales-invoice status and date metadata. It retains only opaque invoice and organisation identifiers, status, and dates; contacts, invoice numbers, amounts, payment data, descriptions, line items, URLs, and provider writes are excluded.

Google Forms is available as a separate Google OAuth connection with `drive.metadata.readonly`. Sneup makes one capped Drive metadata request for Google Forms owned by or shared to the signed-in user and retains only redacted form names, opaque identifiers, and timestamps. It excludes form bodies, questions, responses, owners, URLs, collaborators, sharing details, shared drives, and provider writes.

Mural is available as a separate OAuth connection with `workspaces:read` and `murals:read`. Sneup requires the user to select one currently authorized workspace, then makes one capped request for active mural metadata. It retains only redacted mural names, opaque identifiers, and timestamps; mural content, widgets, comments, templates, rooms, people, URLs, sharing details, and provider writes are excluded.

Canva is available as a separate PKCE OAuth connection with `design:meta:read`. Sneup stores each one-time PKCE verifier encrypted inside its signed server state, then makes one capped design-metadata request. It retains only redacted design names, opaque identifiers, and timestamps; design content, pages, thumbnails, temporary links, owners, folders, assets, comments, approvals, and provider writes are excluded.

QuickBooks Online is available as a reviewed OAuth connection with the Accounting API scope. Sneup validates and binds to the opaque company `realmId` returned in its signed OAuth callback, then makes one capped sales-invoice metadata request. It retains only opaque invoice and company IDs, status, and dates; customers, invoice numbers, amounts, balances, payments, estimates, expenses, projects, line items, descriptions, addresses, links, attachments, taxes, and provider writes are excluded.

Power BI is available as a reviewed Microsoft OAuth connection with `Report.Read.All`. Sneup makes one capped GET request to the report catalog and retains only opaque report IDs, redacted report names, and report type; report contents, dashboards, datasets, workspace membership, descriptions, URLs, embeds, owners, subscriptions, users, and provider writes are excluded.

Data Studio (formerly Looker Studio) is available for Google Workspace or Cloud Identity organizations after an administrator has authorized Sneup for domain-wide delegation with the restrictive `datastudio.readonly` scope. Sneup makes two capped GET requests for report and data-source asset metadata, retaining only opaque asset IDs, redacted titles, asset type, and timestamps. It excludes descriptions, owners, creators, URLs, filters, sections, dimensions, permissions, data-source configuration, and provider writes.

Zapier is available after Sneup is published as a public Zapier integration and receives an OAuth client ID and secret. It requests `zap:all`, makes one capped GET request for Zap inventory, and retains only opaque IDs, redacted titles, enabled state, and timestamps. Zap steps, inputs, linked app authentications, editor URLs, run payloads, user profiles, webhooks, and provider writes are excluded.

Jira Align is available with a tenant API token created by a user authorized for the selected tenant. Sneup accepts only an HTTPS `*.jiraalign.com` tenant URL, makes two capped GET requests to API v2 for portfolio and program metadata without resource expansion, and retains only opaque IDs, redacted titles, type, and timestamps. Descriptions, people, custom fields, dependencies, work items, planning details, URLs, and provider writes are excluded.

SurveyMonkey is available with a View Surveys access token. Sneup makes one bounded survey-list GET and retains only redacted survey title and ID. It excludes questions, responses, collectors, contacts, links, and provider writes.

Google Drive is available as a separate metadata-only Google OAuth connection. Sneup reads one bounded user-Drive page, rejects incomplete pagination, and retains only redacted file or folder names plus timestamps. It excludes file content, web URLs, permissions, owners, shared drives, and provider writes.

Tableau Cloud is available with a pod URL, site content URL, and personal access token. Sneup signs in only to establish a short-lived API session, reads one bounded project page and one bounded workbook page with GET, then invalidates the session. It retains only redacted names, opaque identifiers, project linkage, and timestamps; descriptions, views, dashboards, data sources, owners, permissions, URLs, tags, content, and provider content writes are excluded.

Businessmap (formerly Kanbanize) is additionally available with its API-v2 account endpoint and API key. Sneup accepts one public `https://account.kanbanize.com` URL, uses GET-only bounded active-board and paginated active-card reads, and excludes descriptions, comments, custom fields, files, dependencies, users, time data, workflow configuration, and provider writes.

Microsoft Planner uses a dedicated Microsoft OAuth account with `Tasks.Read` only. It reads bounded assigned-task metadata from `/me/planner/tasks`, excludes descriptions, checklists, attachments, labels, comments, and provider writes, and retains only plan/bucket identifiers for work-graph context.

YouTrack uses a permanent token and a public HTTPS base URL. It makes only paginated `GET /api/issues` metadata reads, requests an allowlisted response shape, strips descriptions, comments, attachments, and custom-field values before storage, and fails visibly at its configured issue cap.

Taiga uses a bearer access token and a public HTTPS base URL. It reads only the signed-in member's bounded project, user-story, and task metadata with `GET`, filters deltas locally with a short lookback, excludes descriptions, comments, attachments, custom attributes, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Backlog uses a project-member API key and a public `*.backlog.com` or `*.backlogtool.com` space URL. It reads bounded active-project and issue metadata with `GET`, checks provider counts before paging, excludes descriptions, comments, attachments, and custom fields, and never makes provider writes.

Freedcamp uses an account API key in the `X-API-KEY` header and reads bounded project, task, and milestone metadata with `GET`. It validates the provider's pagination signal, excludes descriptions, comments, files, custom fields, and tags, and never makes provider writes.

ProofHub accepts one public HTTPS `*.proofhub.com` tenant plus an API key, uses 500 ms pacing below the documented account limit, and reads bounded public project, task-list, and task metadata with `GET`. It excludes descriptions, comments, files, custom fields, people, provider URLs, discussions, timesheets, approvals, and provider writes.

Zendesk uses an OAuth access token rather than a retiring static API token. It reads the bounded, cursor-based incremental ticket export with `GET`, excludes deleted tickets and all ticket body, comment, requester, assignee, collaborator, tag, custom-field, organization, SLA, and macro content, retains only small ticket metadata plus problem-ticket dependency identifiers, and never makes provider writes.

MeisterTask uses a personal access token with bearer authorization and reads bounded active project and section metadata plus task metadata with `GET`. It pins pagination to ascending IDs, excludes notes, comments, checklists, attachments, labels, tokens, and tracked-time detail, and never makes provider writes.

Aha! uses a user-scoped API token against one public `*.aha.io` account domain. It makes bounded `GET` requests for product and feature metadata using server-side field allowlists, excludes descriptions, notes, comments, attachments, custom fields, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Productboard uses a personal API token with bearer authorization. It reads bounded component, feature, and objective metadata through the v2 entities endpoint with a server-side field allowlist, validates opaque provider cursors before use, excludes descriptions, owners, tags, notes, custom fields, relationships, and never makes provider writes.

Toggl Track uses an API token with HTTP Basic authentication and requires one numeric workspace ID. It reads bounded project metadata plus a short, bounded personal time-entry window with `GET`, keeps only workspace-scoped utilization metadata and an opaque user ID for an explicit human-confirmed capacity mapping, honors the provider's 1,000-entry ceiling, and excludes descriptions, tags, clients, people, rates, sharing data, notes, and provider writes.

Clockify uses an API key and requires one workspace ID. It reads only the authenticated user's bounded, paginated project and time-entry metadata with `GET`, retains the opaque authenticated user ID only for an explicit human-confirmed capacity mapping, validates the provider pagination signal, excludes descriptions, tags, clients, people profiles, rates, custom fields, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Float uses a bearer API token. It reads bounded paginated project and date-filtered allocation metadata with server-side field allowlists, excludes people profiles and names, notes, clients, tags, rates, budgets, time off, logged time, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Resource Guru uses authorization-code OAuth and requires selection of one authorized Resource Guru account before syncing. It reads bounded project and date-filtered booking metadata with GET only, excludes resource profiles and names, notes, clients, rates, availability, timesheets, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Sentry uses an auth token scoped to `org:read` and `event:read` plus one explicit organization slug. It reads bounded project and unresolved issue metadata with GET only, validates Sentry's pagination signal, excludes event payloads, stack traces, culprits, owners, tags, users, releases, alerts, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

PagerDuty uses a read-only REST API token. It reads bounded active incident and service metadata with GET only, validates native offset pagination, excludes responders, escalation policies, schedules, notes, integrations, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Opsgenie uses a read-only API key and an explicit `us` or `eu` region. It first verifies the bounded current open-alert count, then reads one matching metadata collection with GET only. Sneup excludes alert descriptions, aliases, responders, owners, teams, schedules, escalation policies, incidents, integrations, URLs, and provider writes, and refuses incomplete collections or configured cap overruns.

Atlassian Statuspage uses a page-scoped API key and explicit page ID. It reads bounded component and incident metadata with GET only, validates fixed-page pagination, excludes subscribers, incident update bodies, postmortems, component descriptions, and provider writes, and fails visibly at configured collection caps.

Generic REST API connects one configured public HTTPS JSON collection with a bearer token. It resolves the configured host before each sync, rejects private-network targets and redirects, pins the request to vetted public addresses, enforces response and record caps, stores only normalized ID/title/status/priority/timestamp metadata, and never makes provider writes or guesses pagination.

Datadog uses an API key plus an application key limited to `monitors_read` and `incident_read`, and an explicit documented Datadog site. It reads bounded monitor and active/stable incident metadata with GET only, excludes monitor queries/messages/tags, downtimes, dashboards, services, SLOs, incident timelines/responders, and provider writes.

- `POST /api/interventions/:interventionId/record-response` - Record worker response to an intervention
- `POST /api/chat/message` - Record card-specific completed, blocked, or needs-help chat updates against an already executed matching communication intervention; generic chat never closes a follow-up

### Webhooks

- `POST /api/webhooks/trello` - Trello webhook endpoint
- `HEAD /api/webhooks/trello` - Webhook verification
- `POST /api/webhooks/generic/:accountId` - Generic inbound work-signal endpoint. Create a Generic Webhook account first, then send a JSON envelope with `id`, `title`, and optional `type`, `status`, `priority`, `occurredAt`, and `updatedAt`. Sign the exact raw JSON body with `x-sneup-signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256>`, using the account's signing secret. Send a stable provider delivery identifier in `x-sneup-delivery-id` to make retries idempotent; Sneup retains only the identifier, status, and signal reference for up to 14 days. Sneup rejects unsigned, invalid, oversized, or malformed payloads; strips all fields outside this allowlist; stores no description, URL, owner, or arbitrary payload content; and never writes to the source system.
- `POST /api/webhooks/generic/:accountId/worker-response` - Signed inbound worker-response endpoint. A workspace administrator must first configure an exact `{ source, sourceMemberId, sourceCardId, memberId, cardId }` binding on the Generic Webhook account. Send only `id`, `source`, `sourceMemberId`, `sourceCardId`, `responseType` (`acknowledged`, `completed`, `blocked`, or `needs_help`), and `responseText`, signed with the same exact-body HMAC. Sneup uses the event `id` as the replay key when no delivery header is supplied, accepts only a configured binding whose source, member, and card match, and records the update only against an unanswered executed communication intervention. Response text never enters webhook audit evidence, unmatched updates remain visible without resolving work, and the bridge never sends a provider write.

**Sneup** - Making project management autonomous and intelligent.

## Connector Sync Safety

Connector work-signal ingestion is read-only. Trello-linked accounts fetch accessible boards and cards through the Trello API; Jira-linked accounts discover their authorized site and query issues through the Atlassian Cloud API; Asana-linked accounts select an authorized workspace and query its project tasks; Slack-linked accounts query accessible channel history; GitHub-linked accounts fetch accessible repositories plus issues and pull requests through the GitHub API; Google Workspace-linked accounts request only bounded Calendar scheduling metadata, Drive metadata, and Google Tasks list/task metadata from fixed Google API hosts. Calendar retains redacted summaries, timestamps, and an organizer identifier only when an explicit local capacity mapping uses it; it excludes descriptions, attendees, locations, conferencing, creator profiles, and links. Drive retains redacted names, types, timestamps, and trash state only, excluding content, owners, sharing, and URLs. Google Tasks retains redacted titles, completion state, due/completion/update timestamps, and an opaque task-list reference, while excluding notes, links, assignments, hidden provider fields, and all writes. Microsoft 365-linked accounts read Calendar summaries, To Do task metadata, and signed-in-user OneDrive root-item metadata through Graph; Linear-linked accounts query bounded issue pages with team, project, cycle, workflow, assignee, and label context; Notion-linked accounts query only pages and data sources explicitly shared with the connection, without fetching page blocks or comments. Sneup never writes to these providers from this sync path. Linked credentials stay encrypted at rest, are excluded from ordinary account queries, and are selected and decrypted only in-process for credential-consuming provider paths.

## Reconciliation Alert Delivery

Workspace managers can configure Slack, Teams, generic HTTPS webhook, or Resend email policies from the Approvals ledger. Destinations are encrypted with `CONNECTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, excluded from API responses and audit payloads, and only send after the policy is explicitly activated. Email requires `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SNEUP_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM`, accepts exactly one plain recipient address, and sends only through Resend's fixed API endpoint. Sneup accepts webhook destinations only at public HTTPS URLs without credentials or custom ports, atomically claims each queued or deferred delivery before any external request, rejects redirects, and deduplicates each reconciliation evidence gap for a policy per UTC day. A concurrent worker observes the existing sending claim instead of issuing a duplicate notification; unresolved sending claims remain in the ledger for operator evidence rather than automatic retry.

An active policy may instead group warning reconciliation gaps into one bounded daily digest at a chosen UTC hour. Critical evidence is never put into a digest. Each digest retains the included delivery IDs, preserves credential-free HTTPS source evidence, and marks those source deliveries as digested only after the external destination accepts the bundle. An independently enabled daily operations brief can also deliver a capped, read-only current-state summary at a selected UTC hour; it is idempotent per policy/day, uses the same encrypted destination boundary and delivery ledger, and never sends a provider write. Webhook and email payloads contain only validated source links. The scheduled `notifications.reconciliation_alerts` and `notifications.daily_operations_briefs` jobs surface delivery health in Job Health.

Provider syncs are deliberately bounded so one account cannot monopolize memory or provider quota. Configure `SNEUP_TRELLO_MAX_BOARDS`, `SNEUP_TRELLO_MAX_CARDS_PER_BOARD`, and `SNEUP_TRELLO_MAX_TOTAL_CARDS` for Trello workspaces, `SNEUP_JIRA_MAX_ISSUES` and `SNEUP_JIRA_PAGE_SIZE` for Jira workspaces, `SNEUP_ASANA_MAX_PROJECTS`, `SNEUP_ASANA_MAX_TASKS_PER_PROJECT`, and `SNEUP_ASANA_MAX_TOTAL_TASKS` for Asana workspaces, `SNEUP_SLACK_MAX_CHANNELS`, `SNEUP_SLACK_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL`, and `SNEUP_SLACK_MAX_TOTAL_MESSAGES` for Slack workspaces, `SNEUP_GITHUB_MAX_REPOSITORIES`, `SNEUP_GITHUB_MAX_ITEMS_PER_REPOSITORY`, and `SNEUP_GITHUB_MAX_TOTAL_ITEMS` for GitHub workspaces, `SNEUP_GOOGLE_MAX_TASK_LISTS`, `SNEUP_GOOGLE_MAX_TASKS_PER_LIST`, `SNEUP_GOOGLE_MAX_TOTAL_TASKS`, and `SNEUP_GOOGLE_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` for Google Workspace task ingestion, `SNEUP_MICROSOFT_MAX_EVENTS`, `SNEUP_MICROSOFT_MAX_TASK_LISTS`, `SNEUP_MICROSOFT_MAX_TASKS_PER_LIST`, `SNEUP_MICROSOFT_MAX_TOTAL_TASKS`, and `SNEUP_MICROSOFT_MAX_FILES` for Microsoft 365 workspaces, `SNEUP_LINEAR_MAX_ISSUES` plus `SNEUP_LINEAR_PAGE_SIZE` for Linear workspaces, and `SNEUP_NOTION_MAX_RESULTS` plus `SNEUP_NOTION_PAGE_SIZE` for Notion connections. If a run reaches a configured cap, Sneup fails the sync visibly rather than silently advancing the cursor and dropping work. Jira multi-site accounts and Asana multi-workspace accounts must explicitly select a source before syncing, so work from an unintended workspace cannot enter Sneup.
Quip now connects through its OAuth Automation API using the least-privileged `USER_READ` scope. Sneup syncs only the bounded current-user thread index (redacted title, type, and lifecycle timestamps); it does not request document or spreadsheet bodies, messages, members, folders, permissions, URLs, attachments, or perform provider writes. Hive now connects through its documented workspace project endpoint using an API key plus the explicitly selected user and workspace IDs. It reads only bounded, redacted project metadata; tasks, conversations, checklists, files, people, custom fields, URLs, and provider writes remain out of the sync path. Planview AdaptiveWork (Clarizen) now performs a bounded `EntityQuery` with an integration API key against an allowlisted US or EU API region, retaining only redacted project names and start dates. Its query request never targets provider mutation endpoints or reads tasks, initiatives, assignments, risks, milestones, people, financials, custom fields, URLs, or other project content. Lucid now uses a `DocumentReadonly` API key to search bounded document metadata through its current REST API. It excludes document content, pages, shapes, comments, owners, folders, sharing, exports, URLs, and provider writes, and rejects untrusted pagination links. Taskworld now makes a single bounded `project.get-all` request to an allowlisted regional API and retains only redacted project metadata. Sneup does not call Taskworld task, milestone, conversation, comment, checklist, file, or mutation endpoints, and fails visibly instead of guessing an undocumented continuation parameter.
