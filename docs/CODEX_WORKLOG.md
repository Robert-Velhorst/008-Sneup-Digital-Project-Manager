# Codex Worklog

## 2026-08-08 governing prompt implementation

- Verified the 124-page source PDF and extracted all 116 named phases.
- Confirmed baseline branch, commit, remote, existing dirty/untracked user artifacts, package scripts, route/model/service/test inventory, and existing production controls.
- Identified operational gaps: no self-diagnostic command, no readiness endpoint, no deployment-wide provider-write stop, no redacted support bundle, no CI workflow, and missing required traceability documents.
- Implemented the doctor/readiness/write-stop/support-bundle services with focused tests.
- Added an audited emergency-stop denial before policy resolution and atomic execution claim.
- Added Linux test/lint/evaluation/audit gates and a Windows installer build job.
- Added the required audit, acceptance, security, runbook, task graph, checkpoint, completion, and verification documents.

This worklog records local engineering evidence. Live Trello, production MongoDB, code signing, hosting, and provider consent are not claimed.

## 2026-08-09 production lifecycle continuation

- Re-audited the active objective against the current pushed worktree and the Trello operations-ledger specification.
- Added an owner-only, streamed NDJSON workspace export that walks collections sequentially with bounded cursors instead of buffering a workspace in memory.
- Added recursive export redaction and made connector credential ciphertext opt-in at the Mongoose query boundary.
- Blocked every provider write when its workspace is suspended, archived, or missing, before workspace policy resolution or execution claim.
- Corrected the JobRun schema so scheduled security/retention work can persist observability evidence.
- Added focused export, credential-selection, UI wiring, and archived-workspace execution regressions.
- Found and fixed a packaged-only Windows startup failure caused by development console logging writing to a detached pipe; packaged builds now select production file logging before server modules load.
- Rebuilt and launched the 2.2.0 package, confirmed the real command-center window and loopback health endpoint remain available, recorded four idle processes at about 410 MB total working set, and verified a normal window close releases port 3197.
- The in-app Browser backend was available but its webview failed to attach twice, so 2.2.0 in-app Browser rendering remains an explicit evidence gap rather than a claimed pass.
