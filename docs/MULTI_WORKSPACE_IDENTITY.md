# Multi-Workspace Identity Operations

Sneup now separates three access modes:

- Environment API key: service-level access through `SNEUP_API_KEY`.
- Database API token: long-lived service or automation credential stored as a hash in `ApiToken`.
- User session token: human user credential stored as a hash in `SessionToken`.

Raw API/session secrets are only shown at creation time. MongoDB stores prefixes and HMAC hashes, not the raw token.

## Workspace Selection

Every authenticated request resolves a workspace context into `req.auth`.

- Normal database API tokens and user sessions use their assigned workspace.
- Local requests, service contexts, and owner contexts may override the workspace with `X-Sneup-Workspace-Id`.
- Optional `X-Sneup-Workspace-Name` is only used when override is allowed.
- Non-owner user sessions cannot jump between workspaces with headers.

Use:

```http
GET /api/workspaces/current
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

to inspect the resolved actor, role, permission set, and workspace override allowance.

## User Sessions

Admins, owners, service tokens, or local owner contexts can issue and revoke per-user session tokens:

```http
POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/users/:userId/session
Authorization: Bearer <admin-or-service-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Robert laptop",
  "expiresInHours": 168
}
```

The response includes `sessionToken` and `authorizationHeader` once. Store it in the client and send it as:

```http
Authorization: Bearer sneup_session_...
```

Session tokens only work when:

- the session is `active`;
- the session has not expired;
- the linked user is `active`;
- the linked workspace still exists.

Revoke a session with:

```http
POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/users/:userId/sessions/:sessionId/revoke
Authorization: Bearer <admin-or-service-token>
```

List active and historical user sessions with:

```http
GET /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/users/:userId/sessions
Authorization: Bearer <admin-or-service-token>
```

Issuing and revoking sessions emits high-risk audit events in the operations ledger.

## Workspace Invitations

Identity administrators can create a time-bound invitation for a new workspace user. Sneup stores only a short token prefix and HMAC hash; the complete invitation URL is returned once to the administrator.

```http
POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/invitations
Authorization: Bearer <admin-or-service-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "new.user@example.com",
  "displayName": "New User",
  "role": "viewer",
  "expiresInDays": 7,
  "deliveryMode": "manual"
}
```

`deliveryMode` defaults to `manual`, which creates a secure link for a human to hand off. Setting it to `email` is an explicit administrator action and sends through Resend only when both `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SNEUP_INVITE_FROM` are configured. Sneup does not send invitation email automatically.

The recipient uses the one-purpose public endpoint below. It accepts only a valid pending invite, activates the linked invited user, and returns a 24-hour onboarding session token once:

```http
POST /api/workspaces/invitations/accept
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "sneup_invite_...",
  "displayName": "New User"
}
```

Pending invitations can be listed and revoked by identity administrators. Invitation creation, revocation, and acceptance create high-risk audit events.

## Invitation retention

After an invitation reaches `accepted`, `revoked`, or `expired`, Sneup retains only its operational lifecycle evidence. The scheduled `identity.invitation_retention` job redacts the invite email, display name, token prefix, token hash, and delivery failure code after the configured retention period. It keeps the workspace/user relationship, role, status, timestamps, delivery mode/status, and one aggregate audit event containing only the redaction count and status distribution. The job processes at most `SNEUP_INVITE_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` records per workspace pass, so a large workspace is cleaned over successive runs rather than creating an unbounded database operation.

## Migration Notes

For existing deployments, inspect before applying a workspace migration. Both commands use `SNEUP_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` and never print credentials:

```powershell
npm run migrate:workspace
npm run migrate:workspace -- --apply
```

The first command is read-only JSON evidence: it reports each collection's records missing `workspaceId`, the target workspace identifier, bounded concurrency, and aggregate-only duplicate counts that would conflict with the future `PolicyRule.workspaceId + actionType` or `JobControl.workspaceId + jobName` indexes. It never returns policy conditions, user data, credentials, affected record identifiers, or record content. The `--apply` command refuses any detected duplicate group before it creates the default workspace, backfills anything, or changes an index. Once clean, it attaches only legacy records where `workspaceId` is absent or `null`; it does not overwrite a record already assigned to another workspace.

Migration, owner export, and permanent workspace deletion use the same complete workspace collection registry. For an isolated pre-production proof against a disposable database named `sneup_workspace_migration_verification_*`, set `SNEUP_MIGRATION_VERIFICATION_MONGO_URI` and run `npm run verify:workspace-migration`. The verifier inserts one schema-bypassing legacy record per registered collection, proves the read-only preflight finds all of them, applies the real backfill, verifies every record is scoped, and drops only that guarded verification database.

Use `--concurrency <1-16>` for constrained MongoDB deployments, or set `SNEUP_WORKSPACE_BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY` (default `4`). Sneup keeps the compatibility backfill at successful database startup, now with the same bounded concurrency; the explicit command is the recommended production preflight and change record.

Recommended production checks before exposing Sneup remotely:

- Set `SNEUP_API_KEY` and `SNEUP_REQUIRE_API_KEY=true`.
- Set `SNEUP_API_TOKEN_PEPPER` and `SNEUP_SESSION_TOKEN_PEPPER` to stable, private values.
- Configure `SNEUP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for the dashboard origin.
- Create an owner/admin user and issue a short-lived session token.
- Confirm `GET /api/security/context` returns the expected actor, role, and workspace.
- Confirm `GET /api/workspaces/current` does not allow workspace override for ordinary user sessions.

Important MongoDB indexes:

- `Workspace.slug`
- `User.workspaceId + email`
- `ApiToken.workspaceId + tokenPrefix`
- `SessionToken.workspaceId + userId + status`
- `SessionToken.tokenPrefix + status`
- `WorkspaceInvite.workspaceId + userId + status`
- `WorkspaceInvite.workspaceId + email + status`
- `WorkspaceInvite.tokenPrefix + status`
- workspace-scoped indexes on Trello/project collections
- `PolicyRule.workspaceId + actionType`

The app defines these indexes in Mongoose schemas. At successful database startup, Sneup reads the same duplicate-key preflight before it changes legacy workspace records or indexes. A connected database with a migration conflict fails closed rather than silently falling back to demo mode. Once clean, Sneup backfills legacy policy rules, job runs, and job controls into the default workspace, replaces the former global `PolicyRule.name` and `JobControl.jobName` uniqueness indexes with workspace-scoped indexes, and then creates the current indexes. Production migrations should still monitor index build time and preserve the JSON preflight output with the deployment change record.
