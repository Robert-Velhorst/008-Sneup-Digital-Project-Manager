# Final Verification Report

This report is updated from executed commands at release time. A passing local suite proves repository behavior under tests; it does not prove live provider authorization or production deployment.

## Baseline

- Branch: `main`
- Starting commit: `b2e98d16d08e267342e56ede90425eb83fd0d7b1`
- Release under verification: `2.3.14`
- Default remote: `origin`

## Verification ledger

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused integrity/migration tests | Pass; dry-run, confirmation, permission, atomic-drift, audit, review-only, CLI, and all-workspace Trello-index migration boundaries covered |
| Focused retention tests | Pass: owner permissions, policy bounds, dry-run exclusions, exact confirmation, pre-delete audit failure, distributed worker lease, UI wiring, and rotation across bounded workspace batches |
| ESLint | Pass |
| Doctor | Pass with expected local warnings for absent MongoDB/Trello configuration; no errors; ngrok disabled locally |
| Full regression | Pass: 103 suites, 789 tests, including workspace-scoped form storage, contextual help/search/focus/routing, browser bootstrap, provider failure, provenance, API validation, lazy-load, and ledger-compatibility paths |
| Recommendation evaluation | Pass: 5/5 scenarios, score 100% |
| Production and full dependency audit | Pass: 0 vulnerabilities after lockfile remediation |
| Release security positive check | Pass: five purpose-separated production secrets, no values exposed |
| Secret-pattern/source search | Pass: no high-confidence credential, TODO/FIXME/HACK, dynamic-code, or child-process finding |
| Distributed job lease | Pass: disposable MongoDB 7 simultaneous race produced one winner; exact-token renew/release, clean reacquisition, expiry takeover, and private-field exclusion passed |
| API contract | Pass: strict `/api/v1` success/error envelopes, correlated request IDs, legacy compatibility, raw HAI OpenAPI, streamed-response compatibility, and static-asset request-ID exclusion |
| Demo runtime smoke | Pass: 12-route HTTP matrix covered HTML, legacy/versioned metadata, security, mission control, jobs, operations ledger, connector catalog, HAI manifest/OpenAPI/snapshot, and a versioned 404 |
| Production database outage | Pass: packaged live mode kept port 3197 closed and displayed a stable, non-secret Windows recovery dialog with explicit demo or close choices |
| HAI HTTP smoke | Pass: versioned manifest/OpenAPI paths, capabilities `snapshot,propose`, provider writes `never_direct`, structured demo snapshot with stable board/card identifiers |
| ngrok packaging/safety | Pass: official Windows x64 native binding bundled; missing, weak, or placeholder remote credentials fail closed |
| Real MongoDB integrity repair | Pass: 40 collections migrated; two safe derived-state findings repaired with two audits; ambiguous Trello attempt remained review-only; provider writes false |
| Real MongoDB data retention | Pass: six eligible categories deleted, six protected records retained, six pre/post audit pairs stored, seven query indexes verified, provider writes false |
| Retention performance sample | Pass: six-category preview 35.09 ms, six audited category batches 936.39 ms, verifier RSS 94.1 MB; seven supporting indexes verified |
| Integrity API performance sample | Pass: 30 live requests measured 14.01 ms p50 and 23.71 ms p95; server working set 119.5 MB after browser QA |
| Startup profile | Pass: three repeat demo samples imported 251 modules in 220.7-275.9 ms at 70.2-71.9 MB RSS, served health plus the complete initial overview in 62.8-81.2 ms at 73.9-75.5 MB RSS, and never loaded MongoDB; hidden help DOM is deferred until first open |
| Optional AI resource profile | Pass: loading offline chat did not load OpenAI; loading the deferred SDK afterward added 122 modules, 6.0 MB RSS, and 4.65 seconds in this cold local sample |
| Browser QA | Pass: prior live disposable-workspace draft/preset coverage remains green; the 2.3.14 in-app Browser also verified contextual Forecasts help, local search, Decision Safety, Approvals handoff, focus placement, desktop and narrow viewport containment, and zero current console errors |
| Windows UI automation | The installed Windows-control package did not expose its required guidance interface; no undocumented input was attempted and visual evidence is not inferred from HTTP or window metadata |
| Packaged Windows QA | Pass: repeatable verifier confirmed 2.3.14 product metadata, healthy demo state, eight redacted diagnostics, HAI `never_direct`, normal main-window close, and loopback port release |
| Packaged idle sample | Pass: the four-process build settled to 356.7 MB working set, 289.2 MB private memory, and 1.734 cumulative CPU seconds after 30 seconds. This is a directional local sample rather than a production-scale benchmark. |
| Windows installer | Pass: local build 109,453,766 bytes, unsigned, SHA-256 `1F55E031B6079FEC3CF56992C4578BBD23893EEC3A84F21449BB5ADB8B672F79`; executable metadata reports 2.3.14 |
| Fresh clone | Pending: exact-source GitHub verification follows the 2.3.14 source push |
| GitHub CI | Pending: the 2.3.14 source push has not yet produced its quality and Windows jobs |
| GitHub installer artifact | Pending: independent artifact verification follows the successful Windows job |

## External gates

Live Trello critical-path acceptance, live ngrok/HAI credential acceptance, production database restore, hosted multi-instance lease observation, hosted canary/rollback, OAuth consent reviews, Windows publisher signing, and assistive-technology certification require owner-controlled accounts or infrastructure and are not reported as complete.
